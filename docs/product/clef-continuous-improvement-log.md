# Clef & Staff Continuous Improvement Log

## Execution Baseline

- Started: 2026-09-13, `dev` at `72b9314`, three local commits ahead of fetched `origin/dev`.
- Restored worktree: `/private/tmp/clef-next-polish` (previous directory was removed).
- Source: Clef & Staff, `lib/main.dart`, discovery home defaults to false,
  Android applicationId `com.mannlab.inc`, version `1.0.0+20`.
- The historical emulator analysis records `com.mannlab.clef`; do not assume that
  installation is this source revision. No connected emulator at baseline.
- No app builds, push, or merge authorized for this execution.
- Reference: `clef-mobilesheets-hands-on-analysis.md`, library/import/export rows;
  tester checklist, songbook and full-backup scenarios.

## Work Queue

| ID | User problem / evidence | Acceptance and failure criteria | Verification | State / dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Songbook entries share a PDF, but full backup stores and restores a copy per entry. | One archive PDF per identical source path; restore shared references, page ranges and setlist IDs. Distinct same-name files stay distinct; legacy backups still restore. | New regression first failed (4 archive PDFs instead of 2), then passed. Store suite 20/20, full suite 448/448, analyze and RC check PASS. | VERIFIED LOCAL |
| B2 | Full restore skips absent archive entries and may replace the library with inaccessible references. | Inspect corrupt/missing mapping behavior; reject incomplete archives before replacing metadata while retaining explicitly missing-file compatibility. | Corrupt ZIP fixtures and existing-library preservation tests. | TODO; local |
| S1 | Split songbook entries inherit source page settings beyond their own range. | Check hidden pages, jump marks and navigation against the claimed song range; reproduce gaps before changing policy. | Controller/model tests and viewer call-path review. | TODO; local |
| Q1 | Friend feedback touch, audio, pedal and mini-panel behavior needs real-use evidence. | Record physical touch/audio/pedal results separately from synthetic or historical emulator evidence. | Android tablet, microphone, pedal and PDF samples. | DEVICE QA |

## Verification Policy

- Per slice: meaningful regression tests, `dart format lib test tool`,
  `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, `dart run tool/rc_release_check.dart`.
- Review formatter diff; check whitespace, tabs and stale documentation wording.
- Each checkpoint records commit, evidence, unresolved gaps and next command.
- A completed slice advances to the next queue item; it does not complete the goal.

## Checkpoint

B1 implemented with store/controller-independent ZIP fixtures. Formatter changed only
the two edited Dart files. No emulator evidence or app build claimed.
Commit subject: `fix: preserve shared Clef songbook files in backups`.
Next: B2, add corrupt ZIP fixtures to `sheet_library_store_test.dart` and ensure
restore validates all required entries before writing files or replacing metadata.
